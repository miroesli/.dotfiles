## Todo

- [ ] Take a look at wayland vs X11 server (display manager)
- [ ] Take a look at sway (for wayland) vs compiz vs compton (compositor)
- [ ] i3 vs sway (window manager)
- [ ] Create different scripts for different OSs and to quickly create / download a rice configuration
- [ ] Take a look at grub boot manager (there is an example in one of my stars)
- [ ] Consider how to be able to switch between different window managers and/or dotfile configs more easily.
